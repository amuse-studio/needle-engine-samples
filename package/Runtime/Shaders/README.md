# Shaders

This sample showcases a selection of different custom shaders that are built with Unity's ShaderGraph and exported to the web.   

Please follow [the documentation](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/export.html#exporting-materials) for more information and instructions.

### What's a shader?
Shaders are programs that run on the GPU with the usual goal of rendering an object. Luckily there are a lot of layers of abstractions, with the top one being a visual graph where the experience is very beginner friendly.

Unity has [the Shader Graph](https://unity.com/features/shader-graph), a system how to define shaders with blocks that represent operations and functions.
