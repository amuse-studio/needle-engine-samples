# Looking Glass Integration

Needle Engine can output 3D scenes to Looking Glass displays. 

This allows rendering multi-view 3D scenes in a holographic display right from a browser, without additional software besides the Looking Glass driver needed.

## Setup

1. [Get a Looking Glass device](https://lookingglass.refr.cc/needle).
1. Install the LookingGlass bridge: https://lookingglassfactory.com/software/looking-glass-bridge  
2. Open the sample with your Looking Glass attached.
3. Select "Start AR".

## Limitations

You can control the camera and UI from your regular monitor, but currently not from the Looking Glass display. This is a limitation in the Looking Glass Web SDK.
