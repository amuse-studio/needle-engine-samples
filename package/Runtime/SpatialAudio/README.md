# Spatial Audio

Spatial or 3D audio is important while making believable experiences where volume is driven by the distance from an AudioSource.   
This sample showcases that by moving around instruments. Make sure to also try it in VR or AR.

The sample also shows how to drive OrbitControls between multiple view positions in the `OrbitControlsView.ts`.

## Usage

- Add an `AudioSource` component and assign the audio clip with an imported asset.
- Use the `3D Sound Settings` and set Volume Rolloff, Min- and MaxDistance fit your needs
- Check the `Play On Awake` if you wish to start the playback automatically.
