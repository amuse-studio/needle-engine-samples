# Spatial Audio

Spatial or 3D audio is important while making believable experiences. It is another layer of immersion worth creating.

This sample showcases that by moving around instruments where you can hear the spatial mixing clearly while transitioning between them. This is much more noticeable while in VR or AR.

Besides showcasing audio, this sample shows how to drive OrbitControls between multiple orbits in the `OrbitControlsView.ts`.

## Usage

- Add an `AudioSource` component and assign the audio clip with an imported asset. 
- Check the `Play On Awake` if you wish to start the playback automatically.
