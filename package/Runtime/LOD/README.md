# LOD - Level of Detail

Is a principle that lets you decrease quality and thus performance cost based on how much a given object is visible on the screen.

For more information visit the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LODGroup.html).

## Current limitations
- Models with multiple materials are not supported, use multiple LOD Groups in that case
- Fade modes are not supported
