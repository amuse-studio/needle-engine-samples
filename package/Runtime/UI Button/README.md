# UI Button

## Events and UI elements

Button UI elements in Unity have On Click event handlers. Same as other event handlers, methods attached to those events are supported by Needle.  

Parameters and dynamic events are also supported. 
This means that creating logic chains, simple configurators, etc. are possible entirely without writing code â€“ for example, you can enable/disable GameObjects or play animations when buttons are clicked.
