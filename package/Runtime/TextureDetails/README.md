# Painting â€“ Texture Details

The state-of-the-art compression techniques in Needle Engine allow for high resolution textures at fast load times. Progressive Textures load a low-resolution version first, and then stream in higher-resolution as needed.

Additionally, runtime USDZ conversion for iOS allows to ship large textures for iOS AR experience, that typically are prohibitively large to download.
