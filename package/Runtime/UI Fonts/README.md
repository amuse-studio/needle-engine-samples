# UI Fonts

## Custom fonts

On the **Text** component you can select what font asset you want to use. There is no global default and it will always be `Ariel`.  

You can import a font by adding the *.ttf or *.otf file into your project.  

Mind that to make the **font styles** work, it is required to have an adequate version of the font, such as `Ariel-bold`, which is not part of the project. You need to supply your own.
