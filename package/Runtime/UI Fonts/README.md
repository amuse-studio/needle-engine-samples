# UI Fonts

## Custom fonts

On the **Text** component you can select what font asset you want to use. There is no global default and it will always be `Ariel`.  

You can import a font by adding the *.ttf or *.otf file into your project.  

Mind that the **font style** is procedural and is not tied to the font and its variants.
