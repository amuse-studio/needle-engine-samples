# Vue.js Integration

This sample demonstrates how to integrate the Vue.js HTML framework and a Needle scene.  

The [Needle homepage](https://needle.tools) is built using Vue.js.

## Package setup

The package.json file contains the additional needed dependencies to use Vue together with vite and Typescript.

## Interaction between Vue and Needle

### Needle Engine as Vue component

The sample contains a simple wrapper for `<needle-engine>` so that it can be used as Vue component. This allows passing properties into Needle Engine, setting up events in both directions, and generally referencing Needle Engine and the scene context throughout your web app.
