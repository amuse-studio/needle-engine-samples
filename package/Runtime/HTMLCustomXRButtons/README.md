# Custom XR Buttons

AR and VR can be started from a regular website when clicking on the respective button. 

Using the `WebXR` component adds these buttons automatically on supported devices, and you can choose if you want to allow AR, VR, or both.  

## Customizing the Buttons

The buttons can be customized by creating your own buttons and connecting them to the respective events on the `WebXR` component. The relevant code is in `CustomXRButtons.ts`.
