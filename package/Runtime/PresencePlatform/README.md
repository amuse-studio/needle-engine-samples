## Room Tracking and Spatial Understanding

Demonstrates spatial understanding and knowing what surfaces are walls, floors or objects. This is useful to create physical interactions with the environment, such as collisions between virtual objects and physical walls.  

## Switchable Walls

Demonstrates interacting with walls and toggling them between opaque / transparent / passthrough. These effects can be combined to gradually reveal or hide the user's surroundings.
