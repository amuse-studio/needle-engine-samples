# Progressive Loading

Is a technique that reduces the __initial download__ size by making the first download with simplified textures. Afterwards, it makes another additional download that updates these textures with higher resolution ones. This process is repeated until the full resolution is reached.

This allows users to enjoy your content faster.

Often on fast connections, this lack of quality on start is negligible. 

You can also hide the texture "pop-in" into a screen fade-in.
