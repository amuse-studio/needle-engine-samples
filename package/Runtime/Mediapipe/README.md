# MediaPipe Integration

This sample demonstrates how to integrate MediaPipe tracking with 3D scenes. MediaPipe allows you to run ML models like hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation in the browser, including mobile devices.  

## Hand Tracking

`MediapipeHands.ts` contains a basic implementation for setting up MediaPipe tracking, asking for camera permissions, and running tracking every frame to gather hand and finger data. You can use it as starting point to add other MediaPipe models.
