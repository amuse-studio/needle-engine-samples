# Shadow catcher

It is used on a plane that is fully transparent except on the parts where a shadow is cast.   
This is especially helpful in a scene where we want to ground our objects, but we do not control the content below our objects or generally the background.

The most applicable case is in XR, where the background is the camera feed.   
This way, your objects make the illusion that they are grounded and a part of the scene. 

## Usage

Add the `ShadowCatcher` component to an empty GameObject to your scene and click the `Assign ShadowCatcher Material` button in the inspector.
