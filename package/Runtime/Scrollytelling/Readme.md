# Scrollytelling

"Scrollytelling" is a powerful way how to enjoy a 3D scene on the web just by scrolling.

Defining what moves and when is quite simple, thanks to Unity's animation ecosystem. Since "scrollytelling" is fundamentally one big animation that is controlled by your scroll wheel.

## Usage

Add the `ScrollTimeline` component to your scene and define the timeline asset.
