# Worldspace UI

UI components inside a worldspace Canvas can be used to build spatial interfaces, for example for XR devices.  
A number of component types like panels, buttons, text are supported.  

Events on buttons can directly be set to trigger events on other components.  

## Font Assets

Text components should reference a Font asset for export.  
You can import a font by adding the `.ttf` or `.otf` file into your project and assigning it to your Text components.  

To use font styles (bold/italic), make sure that you also have matching font assets â€“ for example, `Arial-bold`.  
This also applies to [Rich Text](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/StyledText.html). 

By default, all characters referenced on all Text objects in your scene are exported. If you want to set text dynamically at runtime, you can extend this set:  add an `Font Additional Characters` component to your scene to specify what extra characters you want to export.
